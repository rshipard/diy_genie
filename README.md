# D.I.Y. Genie

## Goals:

I wanted to make a website where you could create wishlist, add friends and then share your lists with them.
Then when you're friends look at your list they can mark items as purchased so no-one doubles up.

## Technology used:

 - HTML
 - Ruby
 - CSS
 - Sinatra

## My approach:

I started with wireframing for the layout, which also doubled as a rough sitemap. Then I created the SQL tables for all the content.

With the basics done, I started with a login page, as trying everything to the user id was key.

## Current functionality:

 - You can create a user
 - Login
 - Create lists and modify them
 - Add friends via their email
 - View your friends lists

## Future Features:

 - Ability to mark items off your friends lists as purchased
 - Remove list altogether
 - Ability for others to collaborate on a gift - sharing how much they are willing to contribute
 - Much better CSS/Styling
