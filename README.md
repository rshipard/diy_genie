# D.I.Y. Genie

## Goals:

I wanted to make a website where you could create wishlist, add friends and then share your lists with them.
Then when you're friends look at your list they can mark items as purchased so no-one doubles up.

## Technology used:

 - HTML
 - Ruby
 - CSS
 - Sinatra

## My approach:

I started with wireframing for the layout, which also doubled as a rough sitemap. Then I created the SQL tables for all the content.

With the basics done, I started with a login page, as trying everything to the user id was key.

## Unsolved Problems:

 - Adding gifts to lists at the front end
 - Removing gifts from the wishlist at the front end
 - Updating gifts withing a wishlist at the front end
 - Ability to access your friends wishlists
 - Ability to mark items off your friends lists as purchased
